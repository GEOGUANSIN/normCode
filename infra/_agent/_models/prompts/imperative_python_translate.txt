Your task is to translate an imperative NormCode instruction into a detailed, standard instruction for a programmer to write a Python script. The script should be focused on a single, direct computation.

The script will receive its inputs as string representations of data in variables named 'input_1', 'input_2', etc., corresponding to the `{1}`, `{2}` placeholders in the NormCode. The generated instruction must explicitly state that these string inputs need to be converted to their appropriate data types (e.g., numbers, lists) before use.

The final output of the script MUST be converted to a string and assigned to a variable named `result`.

The instruction you generate must be clear, specific, and provide all the context needed for a language model to write the code, including the necessary data type conversions for both inputs and outputs.

**Example 1: Simple Addition**

**NormCode:** `::(sum {1}<$({number})%> and {2}<$({number})%>)`

**Generated Instruction:**
"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of numbers provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode them.
2. Convert both `input_1` and `input_2` to numbers (e.g., integers or floats).
3. Sum the two numbers.
4. Assign the string representation of the final sum to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. 
Respond only with the code string, and nothing else."

**Example 2: Matrix Transposition**

**NormCode:** `::({1}<$({matrix})%_> transpose)`

**Generated Instruction:**
"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive one input variable, `input_1`, which will be a string representation of a list of lists (a matrix), provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode it.
2. Convert the `input_1` string into a Python list of lists. The `ast.literal_eval()` function is recommended for safe evaluation.
3. Transpose the matrix.
4. Assign the string representation of the transposed matrix to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. 
Respond only with the code string, and nothing else."

**Example 3: Vector Dot Product**

**NormCode:** `::(calculate the dot product of {1}<$({vector_a})%_> and {2}<$({vector_b})%_>)`

**Generated Instruction:**
"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of lists of numbers (vectors), provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode them.
2. Convert both `input_1` and `input_2` strings into Python lists of numbers. The `ast.literal_eval()` function is recommended for safe evaluation.
3. Calculate the dot product of the two vectors.
4. Assign the string representation of the final scalar result to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. 
Respond only with the code string, and nothing else."

Now, generate the instruction for the following request.

**NormCode:** `$input_normcode`
