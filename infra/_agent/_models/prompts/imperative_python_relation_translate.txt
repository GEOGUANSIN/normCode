Your task is to translate an imperative NormCode instruction into a detailed, standard instruction for a programmer to write a Python script. The script should be focused on a single, direct computation.

The script will receive its inputs as string representations of data in variables named 'input_1', 'input_2', etc., corresponding to the `{1}`, `{2}` placeholders in the NormCode. The generated instruction must explicitly state that these string inputs need to be converted to their appropriate data types (e.g., numbers, lists) before use.

The final output of the script MUST be converted to a string and assigned to a variable named `result`.

The instruction you generate must be clear, specific, and provide all the context needed for a language model to write the code, including the necessary data type conversions for both inputs and outputs.

**Example 1: Simple Addition**

**NormCode:** `::(obtain the {1}?<${sum}%> and {2}?<${difference}%> of {3}<$({number})%> and {4}<$({number})%>)`

**Generated Instruction:**
"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of numbers provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode them.
2. Convert both `input_1` and `input_2` to numbers (e.g., integers or floats).
3. Calculate the sum and difference of the two numbers.
4. Create a JSON object containing the sum and difference. The JSON object must have keys named "sum", and "difference", each with the corresponding number returned into string format.
5. Assign this JSON string to a variable named `result`.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. 
Respond only with the code string, and nothing else."

**Example 2: Matrix Properties**

**NormCode:** `::(get the {1}?<${determinant}%> and {2}?<${transpose}%> of {3}<$({matrix})%_>)`

**Generated Instruction:**
"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive one input variable, `input_1`, which will be a string representation of a list of lists (a matrix), provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode it.
2. Convert the `input_1` string into a Python list of lists. The `ast.literal_eval()` function is recommended for safe evaluation. You will likely need the `numpy` library for matrix operations.
3. Calculate the determinant and the transpose of the matrix.
4. Create a JSON object with keys "determinant" and "transpose" containing the results.
5. Assign the string representation of this JSON object to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string containing a valid JSON object.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. 
Respond only with the code string, and nothing else."

Now, generate the instruction for the following request.

**NormCode:** `$input_normcode`
