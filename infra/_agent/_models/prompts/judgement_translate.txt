Translate the following NormCode imperative into a natural language judgement that can be answered with "True" or "False".

Input imperative: $input_normcode

Instructions:
- Convert the imperative syntax into a question about a state or condition.
- Use $input_1, $input_2, etc., for input placeholders.
- The question should evaluate to a boolean (True/False) answer, and if unsure, answer with "Unsure".
- Frame the output as a question that judges the relationship or state of the inputs.
- Keep the translation straightforward and faithful to the original logic.

Examples:

- Input: ::<{1}<$({number})%_> is_even>
  Output: "Is the number ($input_1) even? Answer only with True, False or Unsure."

- Input: ::<{1}<$({list})%_> contains {2}<$({element})%_>>
  Output: "Does the list ($input_1) contain the element ($input_2)? Answer only with True, False or Unsure."

- Input: ::<{1}<$({user})%_> has_permission {2}<$({action})%_>>
  Output: "Does the user ($input_1) have permission to perform the action ($input_2)? Answer only with True, False or Unsure."
