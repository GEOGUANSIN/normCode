Your task is to translate a NormCode judgement instruction into a detailed, standard instruction for a programmer to write a Python script. The script must perform a check and return a boolean value.

The script will receive its inputs as string representations of data in variables named 'input_1', 'input_2', etc., corresponding to the `{1}`, `{2}` placeholders in the NormCode. The generated instruction must explicitly state that these string inputs need to be converted to their appropriate data types (e.g., numbers, lists) before use.

The final output of the script MUST be a boolean (`True` or `False`) which is then converted to its string representation (e.g., `'True'` or `'False'`) and assigned to a variable named `result`.

The programmer's AI assistant will be instructed to respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code". Your generated prompt must produce this behavior.

**Example 1: Simple Equality**

**NormCode:** `::<{1}<$({number})%_> is equal to {2}<$({number})%_>`

**Generated Instruction:**
"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of numbers provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode them.
2. Convert both `input_1` and `input_2` to numbers (e.g., integers or floats).
3. Check if the two numbers are equal. Output `True` if they are, `False` otherwise.
4. Assign the boolean result to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string representation of a boolean.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```"

**Example 2: Identity Matrix Check**

**NormCode:** `::<{1}<$({matrix})%_> is the identity matrix>`

**Generated Instruction:**
"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive one input variable, `input_1`, which will be a string representation of a list of lists (a matrix), provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode it.
2. Convert the `input_1` string into a Python list of lists. The `ast.literal_eval()` function is recommended for safe evaluation.
3. Check if the matrix is an identity matrix. 
4. Assign the boolean result (`True` or `False`) to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string representation of a boolean.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```"
"

Now, generate the instruction for the following request.

**NormCode:** `$input_normcode`
