Instruction: $input

Execute the instruction. Your final output must be a single JSON object.

First, think step-by-step about how to solve the problem. Place your reasoning in the "thinking" key of the JSON object.
Then, provide the final answer in the "output" key.

The value of the "output" key should be a Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a relationship instance.

Example of the final JSON output for a relation between 'number1' and 'number2':
```json
{
  "thinking": "First, I need to identify the relationship between number1 and number2. Then, I will list all instances of this relationship. Finally, I will format the result as a JSON object with 'thinking' and 'output' keys.",
  "output": [
    {"number1": "value1", "number2": "value2"},
    {"number1": "value3", "number2": "value4"}
  ]
}
```
