Instruction: $input

Execute the instruction. Your final output must be a single JSON object.

First, think step-by-step about how to solve the problem. Place your reasoning in the "analysis" key of the JSON object.
Then, provide the final answer in the "answer" key.

The value of the "answer" key should be a Python list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a relationship instance.

Example of the final JSON output for a relation between 'a' and 'b':
```json
{
  "analysis": "...",
  "answer": [
    {"a": "...", "b": "..."},
    {"a": "...", "b": "..."},
    ...
  ]
}
```
