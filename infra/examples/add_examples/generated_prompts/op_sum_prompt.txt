You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:

1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of numbers provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode them.
2. Convert both `input_1` and `input_2` to integers (or floats if needed for precision, but integers are sufficient here).
3. Compute the sum of these two numbers.
4. Assign the string representation of this sum to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string.

The NormCode indicates that:
- `{1}` refers to a number (likely representing a digit or value in a place like units, tens, etc.),
- `{2}` refers to a carry-over number (also a numeric value),
- and the goal is to compute their sum and store it as a string in `result`.

This is essentially a basic addition operation with explicit handling of inputs as strings that must be converted first.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```
