You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:

1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of data provided by the execution environment:
   - `input_1` is a string representing a number (e.g., "1234").
   - `input_2` is a string representing a unit place value (e.g., "tens", "hundreds", or a numeric string like "2" for the 2nd digit from right).
2. Convert `input_1` to an integer (or float if needed, but typically whole numbers in this context).
3. Convert `input_2` to an integer to determine the position from the right (e.g., 1 for ones, 2 for tens, etc.). If `input_2` is a string like "tens", it must be mapped to 2; if "hundreds", to 3, etc. However, since the NormCode specifies `{2}<$({unit place value})%_>`, we assume the input is a numeric string (like "2") indicating the place index (1-based from right). So convert it directly to int.
4. Extract the digit at the specified place (from the right, 1-indexed) — for example, if `input_1` is "1234" and `input_2` is "2", the result should be 3 (the tens digit).
5. Assign the string representation of that extracted digit to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```
