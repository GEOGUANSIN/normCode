Instruction: $input

Execute the instruction. Your final output must be a single JSON object.

First, think step-by-step about how to solve the problem. Place your reasoning in the "analysis" key of the JSON object.
Then, provide the final answer in the "answer" key.

The value of the "answer" key should contain the actual output specified in the instruction.

Example of the final JSON output:
```json
{
  "analysis": "Step-by-step reasoning about how to approach and solve the problem...",
  "answer": "The actual output as specified in the instruction"
}
```

Execute the instruction and return only the JSON object.
