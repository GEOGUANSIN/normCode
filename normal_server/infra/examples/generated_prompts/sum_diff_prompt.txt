You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:

1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of numbers provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode them.
2. Convert both `input_1` and `input_2` from strings to their appropriate numeric types (e.g., integers or floats). This conversion must be robust enough to handle both integer and floating-point string inputs.
3. Calculate the **mean** (average) and the **product** of the two numbers. (THIS IS THE MAIN TASK of the script)
4. Create a JSON object containing the mean and product. The JSON object must have keys named `"mean"` and `"product"`.
5. Assign the string representation of this JSON object to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string containing a valid JSON object.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Ensure all conversions are handled safely — for example, using `float()` or `int()` depending on the input format, but prefer `float` for generality unless specified otherwise.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: `"thinking"` and `"code"`.
- `"thinking"`: Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- `"code"`: The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```
