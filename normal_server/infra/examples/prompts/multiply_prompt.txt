Your task is to write a Python script that multiplies two numbers.

The script will have two numbers injected into its global scope as variables named `input_1` and `input_2`. IMPORTANT: These variables will be strings, so you must convert them to numbers (e.g., integers or floats) before performing any calculations.

Your script must assign the final product of these two numbers to a variable named `result`.

Do not include any example usage or print statements. Only provide the raw code for the multiplication.
