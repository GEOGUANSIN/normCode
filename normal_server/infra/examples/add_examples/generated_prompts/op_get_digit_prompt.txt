You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:

1. Receive an input variable, `input_1`, which will be a string representation of data provided by the execution environment:
   - `input_1` is a string representing a number (e.g., "1234").
2. Convert `input_1` to an integer.
3. Extract the last digit (the ones place) from the number. For example, if `input_1` is "1234", the extracted digit is 4.
4. Assign the string representation of that extracted digit to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string.

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```
