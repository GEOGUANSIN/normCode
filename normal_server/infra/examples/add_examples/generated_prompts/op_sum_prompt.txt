You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:

1. Receive two input variables, `input_1` and `input_2`, which will be string representations of numbers provided by the execution environment. `input_1` may contain multiple numbers.
2. Find all numbers in `input_1` and sum them up.
3. Add the value of `input_2` to that sum.
4. Assign the string representation of this final sum to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string.


Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```
