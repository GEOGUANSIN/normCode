# Integrated NormCode: User Account Creation

## Original Text
"To create a user account, you must provide a valid email address and choose a strong password. The password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. After submitting the form, you will receive a confirmation email. Click the link in the email to verify your account."

## Decomposition Analysis
Based on pipeline analysis:
- Main: `$what?({user_account_creation_process}, $=)`
- Requirements: `$what?({user_account_creation_requirements}, $=)`
- Password: `$what?({password_requirements}, $=)`
- Confirmation: `$when?(<confirmation_email_received>, @after)`
- Verification: `$how?(::(verify account), @by)`

## Integrated NormCode

```NormCode
{user_account_creation_process}
    <= $=({user_account_creation_process})
    <- :S_user:(create {1}<$={account}> by providing {2}<$={credentials}>)
        <= @by(:S_user:)
        <- {user_account_creation_requirements}
            <= $=({user_account_creation_requirements})
            <- :S_user:(must provide {3}<$={email}> and choose {4}<$={password}>)
            <- {valid email address}<:{3}>
            <- {strong password}<:{4}>
                <= $=({password_requirements})
                <- :S_password:(must be {5}<$={length}> and contain {6}<$={character_types}>)
                <- {at least 8 characters long}<:{5}>
                <- {at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number}<:{6}>
                    <= &in({uppercase}:{uppercase}; {lowercase}:{lowercase}; {number}:{number})
                    <- {uppercase letter}
                    <- {lowercase letter}
                    <- {number}

        <- {confirmation_email_received}
            <= $=({confirmation_email_received})
            <- :S_system:(send {7}<$={email}> after {8}<$={action}>)
            <- {confirmation email}<:{7}>

        <- {password}
```

## Integration Structure

### Key Relationships:
1. **Main Process** `@by` **User Agent** - User performs account creation
2. **Requirements** `$=` **Definition** - Requirements are defined
3. **Password Specs** `$=` **Definition** - Password requirements are defined
4. **Confirmation** `@after` **Sequencing** - Email sent after form submission
5. **Verification** `@by` **Imperative** - User verifies by clicking link

### Agent Responsibilities:
- `:S_user:` - Creates account, provides credentials, verifies account
- `:S_system:` - Sends confirmation emails automatically
- `:S_password:` - Defines password specifications

### Workflow Flow:
1. User creates account with credentials
2. System validates requirements
3. Password meets specifications
4. System sends confirmation email
5. User verifies account via email link
