This concept represents the I/O operation for providing the initial `normtext` to the system.

**Purpose:** To define the entry point for the entire "NormCode Compiler" workflow.

**Process:** This is an input request that signals the `MasterControllerAgent` to acquire the natural language specification from an external source (e.g., reading a file from disk, accepting user input). The data acquired through this operation becomes the `{normtext}` that is then passed to the `BlueprintAgent` in Phase 1.

**Outputs:**
- `{normtext}`: The raw English description of the task.
