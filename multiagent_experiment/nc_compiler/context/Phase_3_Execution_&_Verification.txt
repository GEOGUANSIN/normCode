This concept represents the third and final major stage of the "NormCode Compiler" workflow, where the system acts as the "inspector."

**Purpose:** To run the `{system source code}` generated in Phase 2 and produce a final, verifiable `{execution trace}`. This phase proves that the compiled application functions exactly as specified in the original blueprint.

**Process:** This phase is executed by the `VerificationAgent`. It takes the path to the generated source code and a set of initial `{input data}`, executes the system as a subprocess, and captures its JSON output.

**Inputs:**
- `{system source code}`: The compiled application from Phase 2.
- `{input data}`: The runtime data needed for the compiled application to run.

**Outputs:**
- `{execution trace}`: The final, verifiable JSON log.
