This concept represents the core, sequential process that the "NormCode Compiler" system executes. It is the central algorithm that achieves the system's top-level goal.

It is composed of three distinct, ordered phases:
1.  **{Phase 1: Blueprinting}**: Translates `normtext` into a `.nc` plan.
2.  **{Phase 2: Compilation}**: Generates source code from the `.nc` plan.
3.  **{Phase 3: Execution & Verification}**: Runs the generated code and produces a verifiable trace.

The `MasterControllerAgent`'s primary logic is to execute these three phases in sequence, passing the output of one phase as the input to the next.
