This concept represents the first major stage of the "NormCode Compiler" workflow, where the system acts as the "architect."

**Purpose:** To translate the initial, unstructured natural language description of a task (`{normtext}`) into a formal, structured architectural blueprint (`{normcode plan}`).

**Process:** This phase is executed by the `BlueprintAgent`. It involves a recursive decomposition of the input text, identifying logical inferences, selecting appropriate NormCode operators, and assembling the result into the hierarchical `.nc` file format.

**Inputs:**
- `{normtext}`: The raw English description of the task.

**Outputs:**
- `{normcode plan}`: The formal `.nc` file that serves as the input for Phase 2.
