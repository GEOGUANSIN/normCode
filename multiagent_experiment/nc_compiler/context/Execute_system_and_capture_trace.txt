This concept represents the primary imperative action performed during Phase 3 by the `VerificationAgent`.

**Purpose:** To run the compiled system and capture its verifiable output.

**Process:** The `VerificationAgent` invokes the `main.py` entry point of the generated `{system source code}` as a separate process. It passes the `{input data}` to this process and waits for it to complete. It then captures the process's standard output, which is expected to be the JSON string representing the final `ExecutionState` logbook.

**Inputs:**
- `{system source code}`: The path to the compiled application.
- `{input data}`: The necessary runtime data for the application.

**Outputs:**
- `{execution trace}`: The captured JSON output from the executed system.
