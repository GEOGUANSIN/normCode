This concept represents the initial, unstructured input that fuels the entire "NormCode Compiler" process.

**Definition:** A plain-text or markdown document containing a high-level, natural language description of the task that the final, target multi-agent system is intended to perform.

**Role:** It is the primary input to `{Phase 1: Blueprinting}`. The `BlueprintAgent` reads this document to understand the requirements and begin the decomposition process. It is the ultimate source of truth for the system's design, from which all subsequent artifacts are derived.

*Note: This is distinct from `{input data}`, which is the data used at runtime by the *final, compiled* system.*
