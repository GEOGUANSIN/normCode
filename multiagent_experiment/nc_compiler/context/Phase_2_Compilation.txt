This concept represents the second major stage of the "NormCode Compiler" workflow, where the system acts as the "builder."

**Purpose:** To take the formal architectural blueprint (`{normcode plan}`) created in Phase 1 and automatically generate the complete, executable source code for the target multi-agent system.

**Process:** This phase is executed by the `CompilationAgent`. It involves parsing the `.nc` file to understand its structure, then using that understanding to write the necessary Python files for the controller agent, worker agents, and their tools. This is purely a code generation step.

**Inputs:**
- `{normcode plan}`: The formal `.nc` file from Phase 1.

**Outputs:**
- `{system source code}`: A directory containing all the generated Python files for the new system.
