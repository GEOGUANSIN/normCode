This concept represents the primary imperative action performed during Phase 1 by the `BlueprintAgent`.

**Purpose:** To perform the core translation logic that converts the unstructured `{normtext}` into the structured `{normcode plan}`.

**Process:** The underlying mechanism is a recursive loop that continues until all of the source `normtext` has been analyzed and assigned to a concept in the plan. For each piece of text, the agent formulates a question, selects a NormCode operator to answer it, and then partitions the text to new child concepts, repeating the process until the decomposition is complete.

**Inputs:**
- `{normtext}`: The natural language specification.

**Outputs:**
- `{normcode plan}`: The resulting `.nc` file.
