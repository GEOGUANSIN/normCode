This concept represents the final, tangible output of `{Phase 2: Compilation}`.

**Definition:** A complete, self-contained set of executable source files (e.g., in Python) that constitute the target multi-agent system. This includes:
- The `MasterControllerAgent` with its hard-coded logic.
- All required worker agents (e.g., `ImperativeAgent`, `JudgementAgent`).
- The specific tools required by the worker agents.
- The `ExecutionState` logging mechanism.
- A `main.py` entry point to run the system.

**Role:** This is the "compiled" application. It is passed to `{Phase 3: Execution & Verification}` to be run with input data and produce the final, verifiable trace.
