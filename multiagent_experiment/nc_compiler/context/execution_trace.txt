This concept represents the final, ultimate output of the entire "NormCode Compiler" system.

**Definition:** A JSON object that represents the fully assembled `ExecutionState` "logbook" from the execution of the target multi-agent system. It is not a simple program log; it is a carefully constructed narrative of the execution.

**Structure:** The keys of the JSON object are hyper-specific identifiers that map directly to the flow indices of the original `{normcode plan}` (e.g., `"1.1.2.4 (q1:1)"`). The values are the computational results at each of those steps.

**Role:** Its primary purpose is **verification**. By comparing the structure and values in the `{execution trace}` against the original `{normcode plan}`, one can algorithmically verify that the compiled system faithfully executed the logic of the blueprint, inference-by-inference.
