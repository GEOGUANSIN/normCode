"You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:
1. Receive one input variable, `input_1`, which will be a string representation of a number provided by the execution environment. Do not declare or hardcode it.
2. Convert `input_1` to a number (e.g., float or int) so it can be compared numerically.
3. Check if the resulting number is equal to 0. Output `True` if it is, `False` otherwise.
4. Assign the boolean result (`True` or `False`) to a variable named `result`. The `result` variable MUST be a string representation of a boolean (i.e., `'True'` or `'False'`).

Do not define a function; the script should be directly executable. Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```"
