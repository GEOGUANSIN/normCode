You are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to write a Python script that will:

1. Receive one input variable, `input_1`, which will be a string representation of a number provided by the execution environment.
2. Convert `input_1` to an integer.
3. If the number is less than 10, assign the string `"0"` to the variable `result`.
4. Otherwise (if the number is 10 or greater), remove the last digit from the number (integer division by 10).
5. Assign the string representation of the result to the `result` variable. The `result` variable MUST be a string.

Do not hardcode the input variables in the script, which will be provided by the execution environment.

Respond with a single JSON object containing two keys: "thinking" and "code".
- "thinking": Explain your plan for generating the script step-by-step.
- "code": The full Python script as a string.

Example of the required JSON output format:
```json
{
  "thinking": "A step-by-step explanation of the plan to generate the code goes here.",
  "code": "The complete Python script to be executed goes here as a string."
}
```
