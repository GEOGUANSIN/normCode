### Step 4.2: Manual Review of Materialization

**Objective:** Review the final, executable scripts generated by the automated process to ensure they are correct, efficient, and ready for deployment.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Examine the Generated Scripts (e.g., `.py`, `.sh` files):**
    *   Perform a thorough code review to check for correctness, adherence to coding standards, and efficiency.
    *   Verify that the scripts accurately implement the logic defined in the NormCode plan.
    *   Manually execute the scripts in a safe, isolated test environment to confirm they run without errors and produce the expected output.

**Outcome:** A fully validated and deployment-ready set of executable scripts that fulfill the original high-level instruction.
