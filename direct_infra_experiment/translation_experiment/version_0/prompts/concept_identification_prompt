You are an expert in NormCode, a semi-formal language for planning inferences.

**Background: NormCode Fundamentals**

NormCode is a language for translating natural language into a structured plan. The plan consists of a hierarchy of **inferences**, where each inference is a single logical step.

**1. Core Structure:**
An inference starts with a concept to be defined, followed by:
-   `<=` **Functional Concept**: Defines the core operation (e.g., performing an action, specifying a value).
-   `<-` **Value Concept**: Provides the data or inputs for the operation.

**2. Concept Types:**
Concepts are the "words" of NormCode. The main types are:
-   `{}` **Object**: A thing, a variable, or a piece of data (e.g., `{user name}`).
-   `<>` **Statement**: An assertion that can be true or false (e.g., `<the user is an admin>`).
-   `::()` **Imperative**: A command or an action to be done (e.g., `::(calculate the total)`).
-   `[]` **Relation**: A group or collection of things (e.g., `[all user emails]`).

Concepts are often prefixed with a **Subject Marker** to define their role, such as `:>:` (Input) or `:<:` (Output).

**3. Annotations:**
Annotations manage the state of the translation process:
-   `...:` **Source Text**: Holds the piece of the original natural language (`normtext`) currently being analyzed. **A concept with a `...:` annotation is considered "un-decomposed."**
-   `?:` **Question**: The question being asked about the source text.
-   `/:` **Description**: A human-readable summary of the result of the decomposition.

**Your Task: Identify the Next Concept for Decomposition**

You will be given the current NormCode draft. The translation process is a recursive loop that runs for any concept that has an un-parsed `...:` annotation.

Your task is to find the **first concept** (reading from top to bottom) that still has an un-parsed source text annotation (`...:`).

From the draft below, you must extract two things:
1.  The full line of the concept to be decomposed (e.g. `<- {steps}`).
2.  The `...:` content of that concept.

**Example:**

Input NormCode Draft:
```normcode
:<:(::(register a new user))
    ?: How to register a new user?
    <= @by(:_:)
    <- :_:{steps}({user name})
    <- {steps}
        ...: "first, check if the provided username already exists."
        ...: "second, if it does, report an error."
    <- {user name}
        ...: "the provided username is provided by the user."
```

Output:
```json
{
  "concept_to_decomposed": "<- {steps}",
  "remaining_normtext": "...: \"first, check if the provided username already exists.\"\n...: \"second, if it does, report an error.\""
}
```
**Explanation**: The first concept with a `...:` is `{steps}`. We extract its full line and its `...:` content.

**NormCode Draft:**
---
{normcode draft}

Respond with a JSON object containing two keys: "concept_to_decomposed" and "remaining_normtext".
