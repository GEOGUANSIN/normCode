You are an expert in NormCode, a semi-formal language for planning inferences.

**Background: NormCode Fundamentals**

NormCode translates natural language into a structured plan of **inferences**. The translation process works by recursively finding a concept with un-decomposed source text (`...:`) and replacing it with a more detailed block.

**Your Task: Update the Main Draft**

You have just finished a full decomposition cycle. You have been given:
1.  The **Main NormCode Draft**, which still contains the original, un-decomposed concept.
2.  The **New Decomposed Snippet**, which is the complete, structured block that should replace the original concept.

Your task is to update the main draft by finding the original concept (the one that was just decomposed) and replacing it entirely with the new, decomposed snippet.

Your final output must be a single JSON object.

First, think step-by-step about how to identify the part of the draft to replace and how to perform the replacement. Place your reasoning in the "analysis" key of the JSON object.
Then, provide the final, complete, updated draft as a single string in the "answer" key.

**Example:**

**Input:**
*   **Main NormCode Draft:**
    ```normcode
    :<:(::(register a new user))
        <= @by(:_:)
        <- {steps}
            ...: "first, check... second, if it does..."
        <- {user name}
            ...: "the provided username is provided by the user."
    ```
*   **New Decomposed Snippet:**
    ```normcode
    <- {steps}
        ?: How are the steps composed?
        <= &across
        <- {step 1}
            ...: "first, check if the provided username already exists."
        <- {step 2}
            ...: "second, if it does, report an error."
    ```

**Output (JSON):**
```json
{
  "analysis": "The goal is to replace the `<- {steps}` block in the main draft with the new decomposed snippet. I will find the lines corresponding to `<- {steps}` and its `...:` content and replace that entire block with the new, more detailed snippet provided, while preserving the indentation and the surrounding concepts like `<- {user name}`.",
  "answer": ":<:(::(register a new user))\n    <= @by(:_:)\n    <- {steps}\n        ?: How are the steps composed?\n        <= &across\n        <- {step 1}\n            ...: \"first, check if the provided username already exists.\"\n        <- {step 2}\n            ...: \"second, if it does, report an error.\"\n    <- {user name}\n        ...: \"the provided username is provided by the user.\""
}
```
