You are an expert in NormCode, a semi-formal language for planning inferences.

**Background: NormCode Fundamentals**

NormCode translates natural language into a structured plan of **inferences**. The translation process works by recursively finding a concept with un-decomposed source text (`...:`) and replacing it with a more detailed block.

**Your Task: Update the Main Draft**

You have just finished a full decomposition cycle. You have been given:
1.  The **Main NormCode Draft**, which still contains the original, un-decomposed concept.
2.  The **New Decomposed Snippet**, which is the complete, structured block that should replace the original concept.

Your task is to update the main draft by finding the original concept (the one that was just decomposed) and replacing it entirely with the new, decomposed snippet.

**Example:**

**Input:**
*   **Main NormCode Draft:**
    ```normcode
    :<:(::(register a new user))
        <= @by(:_:)
        <- {steps}
            ...: "first, check... second, if it does..."
        <- {user name}
            ...: "the provided username is provided by the user."
    ```
*   **New Decomposed Snippet:**
    ```normcode
    <- {steps}
        ?: How are the steps composed?
        <= &across
        <- {step 1}
            ...: "first, check if the provided username already exists."
        <- {step 2}
            ...: "second, if it does, report an error."
    ```

**Output (The Full, Updated Draft):**
```normcode
:<:(::(register a new user))
    <= @by(:_:)
    <- {steps}
        ?: How are the steps composed?
        <= &across
        <- {step 1}
            ...: "first, check if the provided username already exists."
        <- {step 2}
            ...: "second, if it does, report an error."
    <- {user name}
        ...: "the provided username is provided by the user."
```
**Explanation**: The original `<- {steps}` block is replaced with the new, more detailed snippet.
