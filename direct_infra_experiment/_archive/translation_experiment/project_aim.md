# Project Aim: NormCode Self-Translation

This project aims to develop a functional NormCode script (`version_0/v1_manual.ncd`) that orchestrates the translation of natural language (`normtext`) into a structured NormCode plan.

The core of this experiment is a meta-algorithm: a NormCode script that defines the very process of its own creation from a less formal input. It leverages a series of specialized prompts to execute each step of the translation, from initialization to recursive decomposition, effectively bootstrapping the NormCode generation process.

## Iterative Development

The development follows an iterative approach, starting with a simpler NormCode script and progressively increasing its complexity and capability. Each version of the translation script is used, combined with manual refinement, to aid in the creation of the subsequent, more advanced version. This strategy aims to continuously improve the accuracy and sophistication of the automated translation process.
