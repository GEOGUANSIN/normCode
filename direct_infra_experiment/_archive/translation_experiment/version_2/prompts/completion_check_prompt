You are an AI assistant specializing in NormCode, a semi-formal language for planning inferences. Your task is to determine if a given NormCode draft is "complete".

Your final output must be a single JSON object.

First, think step-by-step about how to solve the problem. Place your reasoning in the "analysis" key of the JSON object. Then, provide the final answer (`True` or `False`) in the "answer" key.

A NormCode draft is considered "complete" if all of its source text (`...:`) has been decomposed into further steps. A `...:` annotation marks a draft as "incomplete" only if it is a "leaf" – meaning it is not followed by a decomposition operator (`<=`) or value concepts (`<-`) within its scope (i.e., at a greater indentation level before the next peer element).

In other words, if a concept contains a `...:` annotation but is immediately followed by `<-` or `<=` lines that break it down further, that `...:` is considered intermediate and does not make the draft incomplete. The draft is only incomplete if there is a `...:` that is not acted upon.

Analyze the provided NormCode draft and produce a JSON object with your analysis and the final true/false answer.

**Example 1: Incomplete Draft**

Input NormCode Draft:
---
:<:({Love})
    ...: "Love is a deep feeling..."
    ?: What is Love?
---
Output (in JSON):
```json
{
  "analysis": "The draft contains a `...:` annotation that is not followed by any `<-` or `<=` lines. This makes it an undecomposed leaf, so the draft is incomplete.",
  "answer": "False"
}
```

**Example 2: Incomplete Draft**

Input NormCode Draft:
---
:<:({Love})
    <= ::(define the core meaning of {love})
    <- {love definition}
        ...: "love is a complex emotion"
---
Output (in JSON):
```json
{
  "analysis": "The draft contains a `...:` annotation on the `{love definition}` concept, which is not followed by any `<-` or `<=` lines. Therefore, the draft is incomplete.",
  "answer": "False"
}
```

**Example 3: Complete Draft (with intermediate decomposition)**

Input NormCode Draft:
---
:<:(::(register a new user)) 
    ...: "first check if the provided username already exists"
    ?: How to register a new user?
    <= @by(:_:)
    <- {steps}
---
Output (in JSON):
```json
{
  "analysis": "The draft contains a `...:` annotation, but it is immediately followed by decomposition lines (`<=` and `<-`). This means it's an intermediate annotation, not an undecomposed leaf. Since there are no undecomposed annotations, the draft is complete.",
  "answer": "True"
}
```

Your turn. Analyze the following NormCode draft and produce the JSON output.

NormCode Draft:
---
$input_1
---

Produce the final JSON object and nothing else.
