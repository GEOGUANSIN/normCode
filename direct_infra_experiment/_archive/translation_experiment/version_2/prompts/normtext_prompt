**What is Normtext?**

`Normtext` is the term for a piece of plain, human-readable language that is written to be clear and specific enough for a system to automatically translate it into a structured, formal plan. Think of it as writing a set of instructions or a description in a very deliberate way.

The goal is to capture a process, a definition, or a command in natural language that is so unambiguous that it can be reliably converted into a series of logical steps for an LLM to follow.

**How it works:**

1.  **Your Instruction:** You write down a task, a definition, or a process in plain language. This is your `normtext`.
2.  **The Input:** This `normtext` is given to a specialized translation system.
3.  **The Breakdown:** The system analyzes your text, breaking it down into its core ideas and logical components.
4.  **The Output:** The system converts these components into a structured format. In this context, that format is called `NormCode`, which is a formal, machine-readable plan that precisely represents your original instruction.

In short: **`Normtext` is the human-friendly instruction you provide, which is then translated into a computer-friendly plan.**

**Examples of Normtext:**

These examples are just plain English, but they are written as clear instructions or statements, making them good candidates for `normtext`.

*   **A process description:** `"To register a new user, first check if the provided username already exists in the database. If it does, report an error. Otherwise, create a new user account."`
*   **A definition:** `"A user account is a record containing a username and password."`
*   **A command:** `"Authenticate the user by checking their password."`
*   **A data transformation:** `"The number sequence squared is the sequence of numbers squared."`
*   **An enumeration:** `"The number sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."`
