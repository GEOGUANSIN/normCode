You are an expert in NormCode, a semi-formal language for planning inferences. Your task is to initialize a NormCode translation process.

Your final output must be a single JSON object.

First, think step-by-step about how to solve the problem. Place your reasoning in the "analysis" key of the JSON object.
Then, provide the final answer, which is the initial NormCode draft, in the "answer" key.

**Background: NormCode Fundamentals**

NormCode is a language for translating natural language into a structured plan. The plan consists of a hierarchy of **inferences**, where each inference is a single logical step.

**1. Core Structure:**
An inference starts with a concept to be defined, followed by:
-   `<=` **Functional Concept**: Defines the core operation (e.g., performing an action, specifying a value).
-   `<-` **Value Concept**: Provides the data or inputs for the operation.

**2. Semantical Concept Types (The "Words"):**
These define the core entities and logical constructs. They are divided into two main groups:
*   **Object-like (Static entities):**
    *   `{}` **Object**: A thing, variable, or piece of data. (e.g., `{user name}`).
    *   `<>` **Statement**: An assertion of fact that can be evaluated. (e.g., `<user is an admin>`).
    *   `[]` **Relation**: A group or collection of concepts. (e.g., `[all {user emails}]`).
*   **Action-like (Processes/evaluations):**
    *   `::()` **Imperative**: A command or action to be executed. (e.g., `::(calculate total)`).
    *   `::< >` **Judgement**: The *act* of evaluating a statement's truth. (e.g., `::<is the user an admin?>`).

**3. Subject Markers (Concept Roles):**
Concepts are often prefixed to define their role in an inference:
-   `:S:` **Subject**: The primary subject of a block.
-   `:>:` **Input**: Marks a concept as an input parameter.
-   `:<:` **Output**: Marks a concept as an output value. This is frequently used to frame the top-level goal of the entire plan.

**3. Annotations:**
Annotations manage the state of the translation process:
-   `...:` **Source Text**: Holds the piece of the original natural language (`normtext`) currently being analyzed.
-   `?:` **Question**: The question being asked about the source text.
-   `/:` **Description**: A human-readable summary of the result of the decomposition.

**Your Task: Step 1 - Initialization**

You will be given a block of natural language (`normtext`). Your goal is to perform the first step of the translation algorithm:

1.  **Create a top-level concept**: This concept will represent the overall goal of the text. Frame it with `:<:` to mark it as the plan's final output.
2.  **Assign Source Text**: Place the entire, unprocessed `normtext` into the concept's `...:` annotation.
3.  **Determine Inference Target**: Analyze the text to determine its initial **Inference Target**. This is the high-level goal, which can be:
    *   **Action-like**: An action to be performed (`::()`) or a truth to be evaluated (`::< >`).
    *   **Object-like**: A static entity (`{}`), a statement of fact (`<>`), or a relationship (`[]`).

The output should be the initial NormCode draft containing only this single, top-level concept in output enclosing with its `...:` annotation and the determined Inference Target.

**Example:**

If the input `normtext` is:
```
To register a new user, first check if the provided username already exists in the database.
```

The correct output would be:
```normcode
:<:(::(register a new user))
    ...: To register a new user, first check if the provided username already exists in the database.
```
**Explanation**: The overall goal is an **Imperative** (an action), and it's marked as the plan's **Output** with `:<:`.

Here is the normtext:
---
$input_1
---

Produce the initial NormCode draft inside the "answer" key of a JSON object and provide your reasoning in the "analysis" key. Return only the JSON object.

The value of the "answer" key should contain the actual output specified in the instruction.

Example of the final JSON output:
```json
{
  "analysis": "The user wants to 'register a new user'. This is an action, so the top-level concept should be an Imperative `::()`. The plan's final output is marked with `:<:`. The full source text is assigned to the `...:` annotation.",
  "answer": ":<:(::(register a new user))\\n    ...: To register a new user, first check if the provided username already exists in the database."
}
```

Execute the instruction and return only the JSON object.
