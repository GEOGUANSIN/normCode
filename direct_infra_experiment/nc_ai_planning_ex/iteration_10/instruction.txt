Formalize a NormCode Draft Straightforward (.ncds) file into a formal NormCode Draft (.ncd).

STEP 1: PARSE
Use the parser to convert the .ncds into a JSON list of lines.
Each line has: flow_index, content, depth, inference_marker, concept_type.
The parser identifies comments vs concept lines.

STEP 2: FOR EACH CONCEPT LINE
For each line that is a concept (not a comment):

Judge what type of concept it is:
  - {object} → a thing, entity, data structure
  - [relation] → a connection, mapping, relationship
  - <proposition> → a truth value, condition, boolean
  - ::() imperative → transforms/produces something
  - ::<> judgement → evaluates/decides something
  - $ assigning → variable binding operation
  - & grouping → parallel operations
  - @ timing → async/wait operations
  - * looping → iteration operation

If it is an {object}, apply formalization according to the syntax of {objects}
If it is a [relation], apply formalization according to the syntax of [relation]
If it is a <proposition>, apply formalization according to the syntax of <proposition>
If it is a ::() imperative, apply formalization according to the syntax of ::() imperative and add | ?{sequence}: imperative
If it is a ::<> judgement, apply formalization according to the syntax of ::<> judgement and add | ?{sequence}: judgement
If it is an $ assigning, apply formalization according to the syntax of $ assigning and add | ?{sequence}: assigning
If it is a & grouping, apply formalization according to the syntax of & grouping and add | ?{sequence}: grouping
If it is a @ timing, apply formalization according to the syntax of @ timing and add | ?{sequence}: timing
If it is a * looping, apply formalization according to the syntax of * looping and add | ?{sequence}: looping

STEP 3: SERIALIZE
Convert the formalized lines back to .ncd text format, using the parser in the body.

Input: .ncds file
Output: .ncd file with flow indices, semantic types, sequence types, value bindings with the help of parser.
