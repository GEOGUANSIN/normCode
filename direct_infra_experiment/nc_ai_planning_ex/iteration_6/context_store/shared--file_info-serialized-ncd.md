# File Format: Serialized NormCode Draft (`3.1_serialized.ncd`)

The `3.1_serialized.ncd` file is the first major refinement of the initial deconstruction draft. It represents the plan after the **Serialization** pattern has been applied.

**Purpose:**
The goal of this file is to transform the exploratory, annotation-rich draft into a more structured and consistent format. It reframes the entire plan to focus on causality, where every step is explicitly shown as an *output artifact* being generated by a specific *action* or imperative. This creates a clean, repeatable "effect <= cause" structure.

**Key Characteristics:**
-   **Annotations Removed**: All the reasoning annotations (`?:`, `/:`, `...:`) from the deconstruction draft are stripped out.
-   **Serialized Structure**: Each logical step is re-written into a common pattern: an output file or concept is defined, and nested underneath is the imperative `::()` that creates it.
-   **Focus on Outputs**: The structure makes it very clear which artifacts are produced at each stage of the pipeline.

**Example Snippet:**
```normcode
<- {Phase 1: Confirmation of Instruction}
    <= $.([{1.1_instruction_block.md}, {1.2_initial_context_registerd.json}, {context_store/raw--*.md}])
    <- {1.1_instruction_block.md}
        <= ::(step 1.1: Automated Instruction Distillation)
    <- [{1.2_initial_context_registerd.json}, {context_store/raw--*.md}]
        <= ::(step 1.2: Automated Context Registration)
```
This serialized format is a crucial intermediate step that prepares the plan for the next stage, Redirection, where data dependencies will be made explicit.
