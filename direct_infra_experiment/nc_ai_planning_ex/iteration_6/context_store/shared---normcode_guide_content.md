# NormCode Documentation Guide

This directory contains the core documentation for the NormCode system. Below is a guide to the available resources, organized by topic to help you navigate the system's architecture and usage.

## 1. Getting Started

*   **[Introduction](./shared---normcode_intro.md)** (`shared---normcode_intro.md`)
    *   **Start here.** This document explains the core philosophy of "Plans of Inferences" and the problem of context pollution in AI workflows.
    *   It introduces the basic `.ncds` (NormCode Draft Straightforward) syntax for writing plans in natural language.
    *   Covers the derivation strategy for turning ideas into plans.

## 2. Core Concepts: The Vocabulary

NormCode divides logic into "Semantics" (Meaning/AI) and "Syntax" (Structure/Data).

*   **[Semantical Concepts](./shared---normcode_semantical_concepts.md)** (`shared---normcode_semantical_concepts.md`)
    *   Explains the "Entities" (Nouns) like Objects `{}`, Propositions `<>`, and Relations `[]`.
    *   Explains the "Operations" (Verbs) like Imperatives `::()` and Judgements `::<>` that trigger AI agents.
    *   Maps natural language parts of speech to NormCode concepts.

*   **[Syntactical Concepts](./shared---normcode_syntactical_concepts.md)** (`shared---normcode_syntactical_concepts.md`)
    *   Explains the operators that control data flow and logic *without* using LLMs.
    *   **Assigning**: `$=` (Identity), `$.` (Specification), `$+` (Continuation).
    *   **Grouping**: `&in` (Collection), `&across` (Iteration/Flattening).
    *   **Timing**: `@if` (Branching), `@after` (Sequencing).
    *   **Looping**: `*every` (Iteration).

## 3. Data Architecture

*   **[References & Data Flow](./shared---normcode_reference_guide.md)** (`shared---normcode_reference_guide.md`)
    *   Explains **References**, the multi-dimensional tensors that hold all data in the system.
    *   Details the 4 layers of operations: Basic (`get`/`set`), Reshaping (`slice`), Combining (`cross_product`), and Sequences.
    *   Clarifies how "Perceptual Signs" (pointers to files/prompts) allow the system to handle data efficiently.

## 4. System Architecture & Execution

*   **[The Orchestrator](./shared---normcode_orchestrator_guide.md)** (`shared---normcode_orchestrator_guide.md`)
    *   The "Engine" of NormCode. Explains *when* things happen.
    *   Covers the execution cycle, dependency resolution (Waitlist/Blackboard), and readiness criteria.
    *   Details checkpointing, pausing/resuming runs, and the CLI tools.

*   **[Agent Sequences](./shared---normcode_agent_sequence_guide.md)** (`shared---normcode_agent_sequence_guide.md`)
    *   The "Body" of execution. Explains *how* things happen.
    *   **AgentFrame**: The container for tools and capabilities (`:S:`).
    *   **Paradigms**: The distinction between Vertical (Construction) and Horizontal (Runtime) steps.
    *   Details the specific pipelines for Imperative (7-step) and Judgement (8-step) inferences.

## 5. Advanced Formalism

*   **[Formalism Guide](./shared---normcode_formalism_basic.md)** (`shared---normcode_formalism_basic.md`)
    *   The rigorous `.ncd` syntax generated by the compiler.
    *   Essential for debugging, auditing, or understanding the intermediate representation between your natural language plan and the executing JSON repositories.
    *   Explains flow indices (e.g., `1.1.2`), value bindings (`<:{1}>`), and identity markers.
