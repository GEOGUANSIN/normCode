Execute the five-phase NormCode AI Planning Pipeline.

**Phase 1: Confirmation of Instruction**
1.1. Perform automated instruction distillation on the raw user prompt to produce a clean **Instruction Block**.
1.2. Perform automated context registration based on the system context to produce an initial **Context Manifest (`.json`)** and its associated **`context_store` directory**.
1.3. Present the generated artifacts for optional manual review and refinement.

**Phase 2: Deconstruction into NormCode Plan**
2.1. Take the Instruction Block from Phase 1 and perform an automated NormCode deconstruction to generate a **NormCode Draft (.ncd)** file, which includes annotations documenting the reasoning.
2.2. Generate a **Natural Language NormCode (.ncn)** file to serve as a readable translation of the plan for easier manual review.
2.3. Present the `.ncd` and `.ncn` files for optional manual review and refinement.

**Phase 3: Plan Formalization and Redirection**
3.1. Apply **Serialization** patterns to the `.ncd` draft to manage data flow and state.
3.2. Apply **Redirection** patterns to the serialized `.ncd` draft to link abstract concepts to concrete implementations.
3.3. Formalize the refined `.ncd` file into a final **NormCode (.nc)** file by generating unique flow indices, embedding metadata, and stripping annotations.
3.4. Generate an updated **Natural Language NormCode (.ncn)** file from the refined `.ncd` draft to ensure the human-readable version is synchronized with the formalized plan.
3.5. Present the final `.nc` file and its corresponding refined `.ncd` and updated `.ncn` files for optional manual review and refinement.

**Phase 4: Contextualization and Prompt Assembly**
4.1. Perform automated context distribution by analyzing the `.nc` file and the Initial Context Block. Generate a refined **`context_store` directory** containing unique, minimal context files and a **`context_manifest.json`** file that maps each prompt to its corresponding context files.
4.2. Generate a full set of prompt files in the `prompts/` directory using the `context_manifest.json`.
4.3. Present the context store, manifest, and generated prompts for optional manual review and refinement.

**Phase 5: Materialization into an Executable Script**
5.1. Perform automated script generation. Using the formalized `.nc` file and the artifacts from Phase 4, generate the final executable files: **`concept_repo.json`**, **`inference_repo.json`**, and a runnable **Python script (`.py`)**. This process involves synthesizing the `working_interpretation` for each inference.
5.2. Present the final generated files for optional manual review and refinement before execution.
