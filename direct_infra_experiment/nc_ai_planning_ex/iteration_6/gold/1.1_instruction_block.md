Design and implement a theory-led, technology-enhanced human–machine cognition system for gold investment decisions. This system must be built on the six-stage meta-process outlined in the framework, integrating economic theory as the governing logic, machine learning as a data-processing and pattern-recognition tool, and human judgment as the final decision integrator. Ensure the system enforces theoretical consistency, applies three-layer interpretation of technical outputs, and maintains the triangular structure of Theory–Technology–Decision.
