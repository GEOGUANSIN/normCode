Create a NormCode plan that automates the NormCode AI Planning pipeline. This pipeline bootstraps from a high-level natural language prompt and system context into a structured, executable NormCode plan. The automation must be powered by the NormCode plan itself, following the four core phases outlined in the source document: 
1. Phase 1: Confirmation of instruction.
2. Phase 2: Deconstruction into normcode plan.
3. Phase 3: Contextualization and NormCode Interpretation.
4. Phase 4: Materialization into Executable Repositories.
