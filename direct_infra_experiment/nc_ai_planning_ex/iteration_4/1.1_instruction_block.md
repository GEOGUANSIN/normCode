Execute the four-phase NormCode AI Planning Pipeline.

**Phase 1: Confirmation of Instruction**
1.1. Perform automated instruction distillation on the raw user prompt to produce a clean **Instruction Block**.
1.2. Perform automated context registration based on the system context to produce an initial **Context Manifest (`.json`)** and its associated **`context_store` directory**.
1.3. Present the generated artifacts for optional manual review and refinement.

**Phase 2: Deconstruction and Plan Formalization**
2.1. Take the Instruction Block from Phase 1 and perform an automated NormCode deconstruction to generate a **NormCode Draft (.ncd)** file, which includes annotations documenting the reasoning.
2.2. Generate a **Natural Language NormCode (.ncn)** file to serve as a readable translation of the plan for easier manual review.
2.3. Formalize the `.ncd` file into a preliminary **NormCode (.nc)** file by generating unique, dot-delimited flow indices for each inference and stripping all annotations.
2.4. Present the `.nc` and `.ncn` files for optional manual review and refinement.

**Phase 3: Contextualization**
3.1. Perform automated context distribution by analyzing the `.nc` file and the Initial Context Block. Generate a **`context_store` directory** containing unique, minimal context files and a **`context_manifest.json`** file that maps each inference to its corresponding context file.
3.2. Present the context store and manifest for optional manual review and refinement.

**Phase 4: Materialization into an Executable Script**
4.1. Perform automated script generation. Using the formalized `.nc` file and the context artifacts from Phase 3, generate the final executable files: **`concept_repo.json`**, **`inference_repo.json`**, and a runnable **Python script (`.py`)**. This process involves synthesizing the `working_interpretation` for each inference.
4.2. Present the final generated files for optional manual review and refinement before execution.
