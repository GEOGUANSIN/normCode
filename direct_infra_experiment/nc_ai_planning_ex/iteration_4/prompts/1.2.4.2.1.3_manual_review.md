### Step 1.3: Manual Review of Instruction and Context

**Objective:** To meticulously review and refine the outputs of the automated instruction distillation and context registration steps, ensuring they are accurate, complete, and logically sound before proceeding to the deconstruction phase.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Examine `1.1_instruction_block.md`:**
    *   **Clarity and Accuracy:** Verify that the distilled instruction is clear, unambiguous, and faithfully represents the core procedural intent of the original user prompt.
    *   **Completeness:** Ensure that all critical procedural steps from the original prompt have been captured. For example, a multi-step workflow should be fully represented.
    *   **Exclusion of Non-Procedural Information:** Confirm that conversational filler, metadata, and non-procedural constraints (e.g., "only happens outside of peak hours") have been correctly excluded from the instruction block. This information should be registered as context instead.
    *   **Corrections:** Edit the file directly to correct any misinterpretations, add necessary clarifications, or improve the logical flow.

2.  **Examine `1.2_initial_context_registerd.json`:** (This is a JSON file that contains the context manifest)
    *   **Manifest Completeness:** Confirm that all authoritative documents and key contextual details mentioned in the original prompt are registered in the JSON manifest.
    *   **File References:** Check that each `file_reference` points to the correct file within the `context_store` and that all referenced files exist.
    *   **Description Accuracy:** Ensure that the `title` and `description` for each entry accurately summarize the purpose and content of the referenced document.
    *   **Context Store Integrity:** Briefly check the `context_store` directory to ensure it contains copies of all the documents listed in the manifest.

**Outcome:** A validated and refined instruction block and context manifest that together provide a solid and accurate foundation for the subsequent deconstruction phase.
