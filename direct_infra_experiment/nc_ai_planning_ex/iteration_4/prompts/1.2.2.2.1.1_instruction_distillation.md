# The NormCode AI Planning Pipeline

## Project Goal

The project goal is to bootstrap from a high-level natural language prompt into a structured and executable plan using a meta-algorithmic pipeline. This pipeline, itself powered by a NormCode plan, methodically transforms an instruction by:

1.  **Distilling** the user's intent into a clean instruction and registering all raw context.
2.  **Deconstructing** the instruction into a formal, hierarchical NormCode plan (`.ncd`).
3.  **Contextualizing** the plan by enriching each formal step with precise, granular context.
4.  **Materializing** the final plan into an executable script, ready for an orchestrator.

This creates a system that can understand, decompose, contextualize, and act upon complex instructions in a transparent and repeatable manner.

## Core Inputs

Each iteration of the pipeline begins with two primary markdown files that define the scope and methodology of the task:  

-   **`prompts/0_original_prompt.md`**: This file contains the high-level goal that is the target of the decomposition process. It defines the "what" that the pipeline needs to accomplish.
-   **`_meta_pipeline_prompt.md`**: This file documents the methodology used to bootstrap the entire process. It defines the "how" the decomposition and planning will be executed.

For the purpose of this project, these two files are kept synchronized and are updated dynamically through manual modifications to reflect the most current practices and understanding of the pipeline itself.

## The Four-Phase Pipeline

The pipeline is divided into four distinct phases, each with a specific objective:

1.  **Phase 1: Confirmation of Instruction**: Transforms the initial, conversational user prompt into a set of clean, structured inputs (an `Instruction Block` and a `Context Manifest`). This phase includes an opportunity for manual review to ensure accuracy.

2.  **Phase 2: Deconstruction into NormCode Plan**: Translates the clean `Instruction Block` into a semi-formal NormCode Draft (`.ncd`). This draft represents the logical structure of the plan and is designed for human review.

3.  **Phase 3: Contextualization and Plan Formalization**: Enriches the plan with specific, relevant context. It converts the `.ncd` draft into a formal `.nc` file with unique identifiers (`flow_index`) for each step and distributes context from a `context_store` to each of those steps.

4.  **Phase 4: Materialization into an Executable Script**: Translates the final, formalized `.nc` plan and its context map into a runnable Python script, ready for execution by an `Orchestrator`.

This structured, phased approach ensures that a high-level, ambiguous instruction can be methodically transformed into a precise, executable, and context-aware plan.

### Step 1.1: Automated Instruction Distillation

The process begins by feeding the raw user prompt to an LLM guided by a specialized meta-prompt. This meta-prompt instructs the model to perform a sophisticated analysis, separating the core procedural instructions from all other contextual information.

The goal is to produce one key artifact:

1.  **Instruction Block:** This contains the clean, unambiguous, and procedural logicâ€”the "what to do." It is synthesized from the core request in the user's prompt. This is a markdown file.

*From raw--prompt.md:*

#### **Example: Simple & Casual Request**

-   **Input (Raw Prompt):** `"hey can you just get me the latest sales report and email it to me and Sarah? sarah@example.com"`
-   **Output (Instruction Block):** `"Generate the latest sales report. Then, send an email with the report attached to analyst@example.com and sarah@example.com."`

#### **Example: Complex & Technical Request**

-   **Input (Raw Prompt):**
    ```markdown
    Okay, here's the workflow for deploying the new feature.
    1.  Run the migration script on the staging database.
    2.  If it succeeds, deploy the `feature-branch` to the staging environment.
    3.  Notify the #dev-ops channel on Slack with the results.
    
    Make sure the deployment only happens outside of peak hours (9am-5pm PST).
    ```
-   **Output (Instruction Block):**
    ```markdown
    Run the migration script on the staging database. If the migration is successful, deploy the feature-branch to the staging environment and send a Slack message to the #dev-ops channel with the results.
    ```
