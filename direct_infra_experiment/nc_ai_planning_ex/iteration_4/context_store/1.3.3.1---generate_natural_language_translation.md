### Step 2.2: Automated Natural Language Translation

**Objective:** To translate the annotated and structured `deconstruction_draft.ncd` into a clean, human-readable `natural_translation.ncn` format. This step makes the plan accessible for manual review by stripping away machine-focused annotations and presenting the core logic in plain language.

The translation is guided by the specifications in the `shared---file_formats_guide.md` and the full set of NormCode syntax and terminology guides.

### Example Walkthrough

This example shows how the formal, annotated deconstruction of "Phase 1" is translated into a clear, natural language summary.

**1. Input (`2.1_deconstruction_draft.ncd` snippet):**

This is the machine-focused draft, rich with annotations (`?:`, `/:`) that explain the AI's reasoning during the deconstruction process.

```normcode
<- {Phase 1: Confirmation of Instruction}
    ?: How is {Phase 1} specified?
    <= &across
        /: This phase is specified as a series of steps.
    <- {step 1.1: Automated Instruction Distillation}
        ...: 1.1. Given a raw user prompt and system context...
    <- {step 1.2: Automated Context Registration}
        ...: 1.2. Following the distillation of the instruction...
    <- {step 1.3: Manual Review of Confirmation}
        ...: 1.3. To meticulously review and refine the outputs...
```

**2. LLM Translation Process:**

An LLM parses the `.ncd` snippet, focusing on the core concepts (`{...}`) while ignoring the reasoning annotations (`?:`, `/:`) and unprocessed source text (`...:`). It then rephrases the hierarchical structure into a readable, indented list.

**3. Output (`2.2_natural_translation.ncn` snippet):**

This is the human-readable output, which preserves the plan's structure but presents its logic in clear, natural language.

```ncn
The first phase is Confirmation of Instruction.
    <= This phase is specified as a series of steps.
    <- The first step is Automated Instruction Distillation.
    <- The second step is Automated Context Registration.
    <- The third step is Manual Review of Confirmation.
```
