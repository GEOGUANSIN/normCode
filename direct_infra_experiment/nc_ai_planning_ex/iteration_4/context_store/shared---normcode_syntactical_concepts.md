# NormCode Guide - Syntactical Concepts

Syntactical concepts are operators that control the logic, flow, and manipulation of data within the plan of inferences. They are grouped by their function.

### Assigning Operators

| Symbol | Name           | Description                                                        |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$=`   | Identity     | Assigns a value to a concept, often used for state updates.          |
| `$.`   | Specification  | Specifies or isolates a particular property of a concept.          |
| `$%`   | Abstraction    | Creates a general template from a concrete instance for reuse.     |
| `$+`   | Continuation   | Appends or adds to a concept, often used in loops to update state. |

### Timing (Sequencing) Operators

| Symbol     | Name      | Description                               |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `@if`      | If        | Executes if a condition is true.          |
| `@if!`     | If Not    | Executes if a condition is false.         |
| `@after`   | After     | Executes after a preceding step is complete. |

### Grouping Operators

| Symbol    | Name   | Description                                           |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `&in`     | In     | Groups items contained within a larger collection.    |
| `&across` | Across | Groups items by iterating across a collection.        |

### Quantifying (Listing) Operators

| Symbol   | Name  | Description                                        |
| -------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `*every` | Every | Iterates over every item in a collection (a loop). |

### Concept Markers
These markers can be appended to concepts to modify their meaning.

| Symbol                | Name                 | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?`                   | Conception Query     | Appended to a concept to query its value or definition. E.g., `{sum}?`. |
| `<:_number_>`         | Value Position       | To link a positional placeholder for values (e.g., `<:{1}>`, `<:{2}>`).     |
| `<$(_concept_)%_>`    | Instance Marker      | Marks a concept as an instance of an "umbrella" concept. E.g. `<$({number})%_>` |
| `<$={_number_}>`      | Identity Marker      | Identifies the same concept across different occurrences. E.g. `<$={1}>`     |
| `%:[_concept_]`       | Axis Specifier       | Specifies the `by_axis` for an operation. E.g. `%:[{number pair}]`        |
| `@(_number_)`         | Quantifier Index     | Specifies the index for a quantifier (`*every`) operation. E.g. `@(1)`       |
| `*_number_`           | Quantifier Version   | Links a concept to a specific quantifier iteration. E.g. `{number pair}*1`  |
