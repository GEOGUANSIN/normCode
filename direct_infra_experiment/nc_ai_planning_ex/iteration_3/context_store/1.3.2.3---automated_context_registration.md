### Step 1.2: Automated Context Registration

Following the distillation of the instruction, the system identifies and registers all non-procedural information required for the plan. This "world knowledge" can come from various sources, including system context, constraints mentioned in the prompt, or a set of pre-existing authoritative documents.

The goal is to produce a structured and self-contained registration of this knowledge. This consists of two components:

1.  **`context_store` Directory:** A directory is created to hold copies of all raw, authoritative source documents (e.g., technical guides, original prompts, background information). This ensures the context is portable and complete.
2.  **Context Manifest File (e.g., `.json`):** A structured file that acts as a high-level summary and an index to the files in the `context_store`. It provides a machine-readable map of the available context.

#### **Example: Registering Authoritative Documents**

In many cases, the context is not a small piece of information but a collection of detailed documents that provide foundational knowledge. The registration process involves identifying references to these documents within the user prompt or system context, and then creating a manifest that catalogs them.

-   **Input (User Prompt):** "Please execute the meta-pipeline as described in `prompt.md`. Use the `normcode_terminology_guide.md` for definitions and `file_formats_guide.md` for file specifications."

-   **LLM Process:** The model is instructed to analyze the prompt, identify all mentioned file references, and create a manifest that summarizes the purpose of each document and provides a file reference for the `context_store`.

-   **Output:**
    1.  The `context_store` is populated with copies of the referenced files (`raw--prompt.md`, `raw--context_normcode_terminology_guide.md`, etc.).
    2.  A **Context Manifest File** is generated:
    ```json
    {
      "summary": "This context block provides the high-level summary and references for the NormCode AI Planning Pipeline...",
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "Core Methodology and Examples",
          "description": "A complete, practical walkthrough of this pipeline...is provided in raw--prompt.md.",
          "file_reference": "./context_store/raw--prompt.md"
        },
        {
          "title": "Technical Language Specification",
          "description": "The complete technical reference for the language...is detailed in raw--normcode_terminology_guide.md.",
          "file_reference": "./context_store/raw--normcode_terminology_guide.md"
        },
        {
          "title": "File Format Specifications",
          "description": "The specifications for the various file formats...are detailed in raw--file_formats_guide.md.",
          "file_reference": "./context_store/raw--file_formats_guide.md"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
