## Step 3.1: Apply Serialization Patterns

The initial phase focused on cleaning up the raw plan and giving it a consistent structure.

-   **Cleanup**: Removed all informal notation lines (`/:`, `?:`, `...:`).
-   **Serialization**: The core pattern applied was to reframe each step as an *output* being generated by an *imperative*. This established a clear "effect <= cause" relationship throughout the plan.

For example, a step was structured as:

```normcode
<- {output_file.ext}
    <= ::(imperative describing the action)
```

This created a foundation where each generated artifact was explicitly linked to the action that created it.
