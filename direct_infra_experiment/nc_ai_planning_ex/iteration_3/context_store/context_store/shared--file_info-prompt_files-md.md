# File Format: Prompt Files (`.md`)

The prompt files, located in the `prompts/` directory, are the final, assembled instructions ready to be sent to an AI model. Each file is generated during Phase 4 of the pipeline by combining a task-specific prompt with the precise context it needs.

**Purpose:**
These files represent the fully contextualized, executable version of each imperative step in the NormCode plan. The generation of these files is the primary goal of the contextualization phase, ensuring that every action taken by the AI is guided by a clear instruction and the necessary supporting information.

**Format:**
The prompt files are Markdown (`.md`) files. Their content is dynamically generated by concatenating two types of files:

1.  **A Base Prompt**: The core instruction for the task, often named with a `flow_index` that ties it to the `.nc` plan (e.g., `1.2.2.2.1.1_instruction_distillation.md`).
2.  **Context Files**: A set of files from the `context_store` directory, as specified for that prompt in the `context_manifest.json`.

**Naming Convention:**
The generated prompts are typically named using the `flow_index` and a descriptive title from the corresponding prompt object in the `.nc` file, for example: `[1.2.2.2.]1.1_instruction_distillation.md`. This ensures that each generated prompt is traceable back to its origin in the formal plan.
