# Refinement Questions for NormCode Derivation

Use these questions to refine vague or underspecified instructions into concrete, executable plans.

## The 7 Refinement Questions

### 1. WHAT is the final output?
- What exactly should be produced at the end?
- What format should it be in (text, JSON, file, etc.)?
- What fields/properties must it contain?

### 2. WHAT are the inputs?
- What data/files/information are given at the start?
- What format are they in?
- Are there any constraints on input size/structure?

### 3. HOW should the main transformation happen?
- What is the core logic or algorithm?
- Are there specific steps that must occur in order?
- What tools/capabilities are needed (LLM, file I/O, computation)?

### 4. Are there ITERATIONS needed?
- Does anything need to happen "for each" item in a collection?
- What is the collection being iterated over?
- What should be produced per iteration?

### 5. Are there CONDITIONS or branching?
- Are there "if/then" decisions to make?
- What conditions trigger different paths?
- What happens in each branch?

### 6. What INTERMEDIATE results are needed?
- What must be computed before the final output?
- Are there dependencies between intermediate steps?
- What should each intermediate step produce?

### 7. What could go WRONG and how to handle it?
- What errors or edge cases might occur?
- Should there be validation steps?
- Are there fallbacks or retries needed?

## How to Apply

For each question:
1. Read the original instruction
2. Determine if the instruction already answers this question clearly
3. If not, infer a reasonable answer from context
4. Document your answer explicitly

The goal is to transform vague intent into concrete, unambiguous steps.
