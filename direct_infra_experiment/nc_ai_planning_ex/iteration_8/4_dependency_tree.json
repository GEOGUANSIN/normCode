{'thinking': "Starting from the goal concept 'result'. First, I identify what operation produces this goal: according to dependencies, 'return the result' produces 'result'. This is a multi_input pattern since it takes the sum and returns it as output. The operation 'return the result' needs 'sum' as input. Now, tracing 'sum': it's produced by 'add numbers together', which is a computation operation that follows a linear pattern with multiple inputs. 'add numbers together' needs 'two numbers' as input. Tracing 'two numbers': it's produced by 'accept two input numbers', which is a file_io operation that collects the initial inputs. 'two numbers' has no producer (it's an input), so it's a ground concept. The components 'first number' and 'second number' are parts of 'two numbers' but are not produced by separate operations - they're extracted from the input collection. All paths lead to the ground concept 'two numbers'. There are no iterations, conditions, or complex control flow - just a simple linear chain with multiple inputs. The tree depth is 4: result ← return ← sum ← add ← two numbers.", 'tree': {'root': 'result', 'nodes': {'result': {'producer': 'return the result', 'pattern': 'multi_input', 'children': ['sum'], 'context': None, 'is_ground': False}, 'sum': {'producer': 'add numbers together', 'pattern': 'linear', 'children': ['two numbers'], 'context': None, 'is_ground': False}, 'two numbers': {'producer': 'accept two input numbers', 'pattern': 'linear', 'children': [], 'context': None, 'is_ground': True}}}, 'ground_concepts': ['two numbers'], 'depth': 4}
