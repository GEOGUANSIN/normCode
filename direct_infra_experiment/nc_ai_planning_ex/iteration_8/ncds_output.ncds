{'thinking': "Starting from the root concept 'result'. This is a multi-input pattern where 'return the result' produces the final output using 'sum' as input. The 'sum' concept is produced by 'add numbers together', which takes 'two numbers' as its input. 'two numbers' is a ground concept, produced by 'accept two input numbers', with no further children — meaning it's an input source. Since there are no iterations or conditions, this is a straightforward linear dependency chain with one branching point at the top for multi-input handling. I serialize top-down: first declare the goal '<- {result}', then its producer, then dependencies. The operation 'return the result' only has one explicit input ('sum'), so despite being labeled 'multi_input', it functions like a linear chain here. Indentation increases by 4 spaces per level. 'two numbers' gets a '/: Ground' comment since it's an input. No context markers (<*) are needed — no loops or conditionals. Total depth is 4 levels.
