### Step 3.2: Manual Review of Contextualization

**Objective:** To meticulously validate the context mapping, ensuring every inference in the plan is linked to a set of precise, minimal, and sufficient context files, ready for the final script generation phase. This step is critical for refining the automated output and guaranteeing high-quality materialization.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Examine `3.2_context_manifest.json` for Correctness and Precision:**
    *   **No Raw Files**: The primary check is to confirm that **no inference maps directly to a `raw---*.md` guide**. All raw knowledge must be deconstructed into targeted `shared---*.md` or step-specific files. The presence of a `raw---` mapping indicates an incomplete contextualization.
    *   **Relevance Check**: For each inference (e.g., `"1.3.3.2.object| {step 2.1...}"`), review its list of mapped context files. Ask: "Is every file in this list strictly necessary for this specific step?" Remove any that are irrelevant.
    *   **Sufficiency Check**: Conversely, ask: "Is the provided context sufficient for this step to be executed without ambiguity?" As we saw with `step 2.2`, some steps may require additional context files (e.g., syntax guides) to be fully defined. Add any missing, relevant context files.

2.  **Examine the `context_store` for Quality:**
    *   **Review `shared---*.md` Files**: Open the shared context files. Verify that each one is focused on a single, coherent topic (e.g., `shared---normcode_core_syntax.md` should only contain syntax). If a file covers too many topics, it should be broken down further.
    *   **Review Step-Specific Files (`{index}---*.md`)**: Check any step-specific context files. Ensure they contain information that is genuinely unique to that step. If the content could apply to other steps, refactor it into a new shared file.

**Outcome:** A validated and refined context manifest where every inference is linked to the precise, necessary, and sufficient context it needs. This provides a solid and reliable foundation for the automated script generation in Phase 4.
