# [TASK]

## [MAIN INSTRUCTION]
### Step 2.4: Manual Review of Deconstruction

**Objective:** Review and validate the logical structure of the NormCode plan generated from the instruction block.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Examine `2.1_deconstruction_draft.ncd`:**
    *   Trace the flow of inferences (`<-`) to ensure they logically connect.
    *   Review the annotations (`/:` and `?:`) to confirm that the reasoning behind the structure is sound.
    *   Verify that all requirements from the instruction block have been captured.

2.  **Examine `2.2_natural_translation.ncn`:**
    *   Read the plain-text version of the plan to ensure its intent is clear and matches the requirements.
    *   Use this file as a high-level guide to understanding the more formal `.ncd` file.

3.  **Examine `2.3_deconstruction.nc`:**
    *   Review the formalized plan to ensure it accurately reflects the structure of the `.ncd` and is ready for contextualization.

**Outcome:** A logically sound and validated plan structure, ready for the contextualization phase.
