# File Format: Deconstruction Draft (`2.1_deconstruction_draft.ncd`)

The `2.1_deconstruction_draft.ncd` file is the **initial blueprint** of the plan, representing the first direct translation from the natural language `instruction_block.md` into the semi-formal NormCode structure.

**Purpose:**
This file's primary role is to act as a transparent and human-readable record of the automated deconstruction process (Phase 2). It captures not just the logical structure of the plan but also the reasoning behind each decomposition step, making it invaluable for debugging and verifying the initial translation. It is the raw, unrefined output before any formalization patterns are applied.

**Key Characteristics:**
-   **Rich with Annotations:** This is its defining feature. The file is filled with annotations that expose the "thought process" of the deconstruction agent:
    -   `?:` (Question): Documents the question the agent asked itself to break down a concept.
    -   `/:` (Description): Provides a human-readable summary of an inference's purpose.
    -   `...:` (Source Text): Contains the original natural language snippet that is being deconstructed.
-   **Hierarchical Structure:** It maintains the full, indented hierarchy of the plan as inferred from the source instructions.

**Example Snippet:**
```normcode
<- {Phase 1: Confirmation of Instruction}
    ?: How is {Phase 1} specified?
    <= &across
        /: This phase is specified as a series of steps.
    <- {step 1.1: Automated Instruction Distillation}
        ...: 1.1. Perform automated instruction distillation...
```
This file serves as the foundational draft upon which all subsequent refinement steps (Serialization, Redirection, Formalization) are built.

# File Format: Serialized NormCode Draft (`3.1_serialized.ncd`)

The `3.1_serialized.ncd` file is the first major refinement of the initial deconstruction draft. It represents the plan after the **Serialization** pattern has been applied.

**Purpose:**
The goal of this file is to transform the exploratory, annotation-rich draft into a more structured and consistent format. It reframes the entire plan to focus on causality, where every step is explicitly shown as an *output artifact* being generated by a specific *action* or imperative. This creates a clean, repeatable "effect <= cause" structure.

**Key Characteristics:**
-   **Annotations Removed**: All the reasoning annotations (`?:`, `/:`, `...:`) from the deconstruction draft are stripped out.
-   **Serialized Structure**: Each logical step is re-written into a common pattern: an output file or concept is defined, and nested underneath is the imperative `::()` that creates it.
-   **Focus on Outputs**: The structure makes it very clear which artifacts are produced at each stage of the pipeline.

**Example Snippet:**
```normcode
<- {Phase 1: Confirmation of Instruction}
    <= $.([{1.1_instruction_block.md}, {1.2_initial_context_registerd.json}, {context_store/raw--*.md}])
    <- {1.1_instruction_block.md}
        <= ::(step 1.1: Automated Instruction Distillation)
    <- [{1.2_initial_context_registerd.json}, {context_store/raw--*.md}]
        <= ::(step 1.2: Automated Context Registration)
```
This serialized format is a crucial intermediate step that prepares the plan for the next stage, Redirection, where data dependencies will be made explicit.

## 1. Introduction

NormCode is a semi-formal language used to construct a **plan of inferences**. It is designed to represent complex reasoning and data processing tasks not as a single, monolithic script, but as a structured combination of multiple, distinct inferences. It is considered semi-formal because the concepts are not merely placeholders; their semantic meaning is important to the functioning of the NormCode, particularly when an inference's logic is executed by a language model.

Each **inference** within the plan is a self-contained logical operation. The entire Normcode script orchestrates how these individual inferences connect and flow to achieve a larger goal.

## 2. Core Syntax: Concepts, and Inferences

The fundamental unit of a Normcode plan is the **inference**. An inference is defined by a functional concept and its associated value concepts.

-   **Functional Concept (`<=`)**: This is the cornerstone of an inference. It "pins down" the inference by defining its core logic, function, or operation. Crucially, the functional concept is responsible for **invoking an agent's sequence** (e.g., `quantifying`, `imperative`), which is the underlying engine that executes the inference's logic.

-   **Value Concept (`<-`)**: This concept provides the concrete data for the inference. It specifies the inputs, outputs, parameters, or results that the functional concept operates on or produces.

The entire plan is represented in a hierarchical, vertical format. An inference begins with a root concept, followed by an indented functional concept (`<=`) that defines the operation. The value concepts (`<-`) are then supplied at the same or a more deeply nested level.

A line in Normcode can also have optional annotations for clarity and control:

`_concept_definition_ | _annotation_ // _comment_`

-   **`_concept_definition_`**: The core functional (`<=`) or value (`<-`) statement.
-   **`_annotation_`**: Optional metadata following the `|` symbol. This can be a **flow index** (e.g., `1.1.2`), an intended **data reference**, or the name of the invoked **agent's sequence**.
-   **`// _comment_`**: Human-readable comments.

### 2.1. Drafting Annotations (for `.ncd` files)
During the deconstruction phase, `.ncd` (NormCode Draft) files use a special set of annotations to document the translation process:

-   `...:` **Source Text**: Holds the piece of the original natural language (`normtext`) currently being analyzed. A concept with a `...:` annotation is considered "un-decomposed."
-   `?:` **Question**: The question being asked about the source text to guide the decomposition.
-   `/:` **Description**: A human-readable summary of the result of a decomposition, marking a concept as definitive and complete.


**Example Structure of an Inference:**
```Normcode
_concept_to_infer_ // The overall goal of this inference
    <= _functional_concept_defining_the_operation_ | 
    quantifying // This invokes the 'quantifying' agent's sequence
    <- _input_value_concept_1_ // This is an input for the 
    operation
    <- _input_value_concept_2_
```

**Example of a Concrete Inference:**

The following snippet from an addition algorithm shows an `imperative` inference.

```Normcode
<- {digit sum} | 1.1.2. imperative
    <= ::(sum {1}<$([all {unit place value} of numbers])%_> and {2}<$({carry-over number}*1)%_> to get {3}?<$({sum})%_>)
    <- [all {unit place value} of numbers]<:{1}>
    <- {carry-over number}*1<:{2}>
    <- {sum}?<:{3}>
```
- **Goal**: The overall goal is to produce a `{digit sum}`.
- **Functional Concept (`<=`)**: The core of the inference is the `::` (imperative) concept, which defines a command to sum two numbers. This invokes the `imperative` agent's sequence.
- **Value Concepts (`<-`)**: It takes two inputs (`[all {unit place value} of numbers]` and `{carry-over number}*1`) and specifies one output (`{sum}`).

## 3. Concept Types

Concepts are the building blocks of NormCode and are divided into two major classes: **Semantical** and **Syntactical**. The core inference operators (`<=` and `<-`) are explained in the Core Syntax section above.

### 3.1. Semantical Concept Types

Semantical concepts define the core entities and logical constructs of the domain. They can be subdivided into typically non-functional and functional types.

#### 3.1.1. Typically Non-Functional Concept Types
These concepts represent entities, their relationships, or their roles in the inference.

| Symbol                | Name                      | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{}`                  | Object                    | Represents a generic object or entity.                                      |
| `<>`                  | Statement                 | Represents a proposition or a state of affairs (non-functional).            |
| `[]`                  | Relation                  | Represents a relationship between two or more concepts.                     |
| `:S:`                 | Subject                   | Marks the subject of a relation or statement.                               |
| `:>:`                 | Input                     | A special type of Subject that marks a concept as an input parameter.       |
| `:<:`                 | Output                    | A special type of Subject that marks a concept as an output value.          |

**Examples:**
- **Object (`{}`):** `{new number pair}` declares a concept that will hold the state of the two numbers as they are processed.
- **Statement (`<>`):** `<all number is 0>` represents a condition that can be evaluated. The `judgement` agent's sequence will determine if this statement is true or false.
- **Relation (`[]`):** `[all {unit place value} of numbers]` defines a collection that will hold the digits from a specific place value of the numbers being added.

#### 3.1.2. Typically Functional Concept Types
These concepts define operations or evaluations that often initiate an inference.

| Symbol                | Name                      | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `({})` or `::()`      | Imperative                | Represents a command or an action to be executed.                           |
| `<{}>` or `<...>`     | Judgement                 | Represents an evaluation that results in a boolean-like assessment.         |

**Examples:**
- **Imperative (`::()`):** `::(get the {1}?<$({remainder})%_> of {2}<$({digit sum})%_> divided by 10)` issues a command to a tool or model to perform a calculation. This is the heart of an `imperative` inference.
- **Judgement (`<...>`):** `<= :%(True):<{1}<$({carry-over number})%_> is 0>` evaluates whether the carry-over is zero. This is the core of a `judgement` inference. Note the use of `<...>` as a common syntax variant for a judgement.

### 3.2. Syntactical Concept Types

Syntactical concepts are operators that control the logic, flow, and manipulation of data within the plan of inferences. They are grouped by their function.

#### 3.2.1. Assigning Operators

| Symbol | Name           | Description                                                        |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$=`   | Identity     | Assigns a value to a concept, often used for state updates.          |
| `$.`   | Specification  | Specifies or isolates a particular property of a concept.          |
| `$%`   | Abstraction    | Creates a general template from a concrete instance for reuse.     |
| `$+`   | Continuation   | Appends or adds to a concept, often used in loops to update state. |

**Examples:**
- **Identity (`$=`):** `<- {number pair}<$={1}>` is used to give a stable identity (`1`) to the `{number pair}` concept across multiple steps of the algorithm.
- **Specification (`$.`):** `<= $.({remainder})` specifies that this part of the inference is focused solely on defining the `{remainder}`.
- **Abstraction (`$%`):** `<$([all {unit place value} of numbers])%_>` takes the concrete list of digits and abstracts it as an input parameter for the `sum` imperative.
- **Continuation (`$+`):** `<= $+({number pair to append}:{number pair})` defines an operation that updates the `{number pair}` for the next iteration of a loop.

#### 3.2.2. Timing (Sequencing) Operators

| Symbol     | Name      | Description                               |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `@if`      | If        | Executes if a condition is true.          |
| `@if!`     | If Not    | Executes if a condition is false.         |
| `@after`   | After     | Executes after a preceding step is complete. |

**Examples:**
- **If / If Not (`@if`, `@if!`):** The combination ` @if!(<all number is 0>)` and `@if(<carry-over number is 0>)` forms the termination condition for the main loop, ensuring it continues as long as there are digits to process or a carry-over exists.
- **After (`@after`):** ` <= @after({digit sum})` ensures that the remainder is only calculated *after* the `digit sum` has been computed in a prior step.

#### 3.2.3. Grouping Operators

| Symbol    | Name   | Description                                           |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `&in`     | In     | Groups items contained within a larger collection.    |
| `&across` | Across | Groups items by iterating across a collection.        |

**Examples:**
- **Across (`&across`):** `<= &across({unit place value}:{number pair}*1)` is a `grouping` inference that iterates across the two numbers in the `{number pair}` and extracts the `{unit place value}` (the rightmost digit) from each, creating a new group of digits to be summed.
- **In (`&in`):** Used to create a collection from explicitly listed value concepts. The elements to be grouped are provided as `<-` concepts within the inference.
  ```Normcode
  <- [my collection] | grouping
      <= &in({item})
      <- {item A}
      <- {item B}
  ```

#### 3.2.4. Quantifying (Listing) Operators

| Symbol   | Name  | Description                                        |
| -------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `*every` | Every | Iterates over every item in a collection (a loop). |

**Example:**
- **Every (`*every`):** `<= *every({number pair})` defines the main loop of the addition algorithm. This functional concept invokes the `quantifying` agent's sequence, which will continue to execute its child inferences as long as the termination condition (defined with `@if` operators) is not met.

#### 3.2.5. Concept Markers
These markers can be appended to concepts to modify their meaning.

| Symbol                | Name                 | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `?`                   | Conception Query     | Appended to a concept to query its value or definition. E.g., `{sum}?`. |
| `<:_number_>`         | Value Position       | To link a positional placeholder for values (e.g., `<:{1}>`, `<:{2}>`).     |
| `<$(_concept_)%_>`    | Instance Marker      | Marks a concept as an instance of an "umbrella" concept. E.g. `<$({number})%_>` |
| `<$={_number_}>`      | Identity Marker      | Identifies the same concept across different occurrences. E.g. `<$={1}>`     |
| `%:[_concept_]`       | Axis Specifier       | Specifies the `by_axis` for an operation. E.g. `%:[{number pair}]`        |
| `@(_number_)`         | Quantifier Index     | Specifies the index for a quantifier (`*every`) operation. E.g. `@(1)`       |
| `*_number_`           | Quantifier Version   | Links a concept to a specific quantifier iteration. E.g. `{number pair}*1`  |

## Step 3.1: Apply Serialization Patterns

The initial phase focused on cleaning up the raw plan and giving it a consistent structure.

-   **Cleanup**: Removed all informal notation lines (`/:`, `?:`, `...:`).
-   **Serialization**: The core pattern applied was to reframe each step as an *output* being generated by an *imperative*. This established a clear "effect <= cause" relationship throughout the plan.

For example, a step was structured as:

```normcode
<- {output_file.ext}
    <= ::(imperative describing the action)
```

This created a foundation where each generated artifact was explicitly linked to the action that created it.
