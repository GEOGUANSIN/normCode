Implement the five-stage meta-framework for gold investment decisions, where economic and financial theory governs the process, machine learning enhances data processing and pattern recognition, and the human integrates both to make final investment decisions. The framework includes: (1) establishing a theoretical stance and self-positioning, (2) acquiring and structuring theory-driven data, (3) diagnosing market states and detecting narratives, (4) modeling pricing mechanisms and generating theory-consistent signals, (5) making decisions with risk control anchored in theory.
