# **Core of the Meta-Framework for Gold Investment Decisions**

### **A Theory-Led, Technology-Enhanced Human–Machine Cognition System**

## **1. Fundamental Paradigm: Theory First, Technology Enhanced**

Gold investment decisions should be built on a meta-framework in which **economic and financial theory serves as the primary governing system**, and **machine learning acts as an extension of that theoretical system**.
In this paradigm:

* **Theory** defines logical structure, causal relationships, and what information truly matters.
* **Machine learning** provides pattern recognition, data processing, and probabilistic assessment.
* **The human decision-maker** integrates theory and technology to make final judgments.

The central objective is not to let technology replace judgment, but to use technology as a **sensor and amplifier** of theoretical reasoning.

# **2. The Six-Stage Meta-Process**

### **Stage 1 — Establishing the Theoretical Framework and Self-Positioning**

The investor must define their theoretical stance (real-rate models, monetary-system perspective, behavioral/flow-based views), their role (allocator, trader, speculator), and risk tolerance. Human–machine responsibilities are allocated: theory and value judgments remain with the human; data and pattern tasks go to the machine.

### **Stage 2 — Data Acquisition and Structuring**

Data sources are chosen according to theory: macro indicators, central bank communication, geopolitics, and market microstructure.
Machine learning cleans and structures numerical data; LLMs extract meaning from text.
All technical outputs are **preliminary signals** requiring theoretical validation.

### **Stage 3 — Market State Diagnosis and Narrative Detection**

Quantitative models identify market regimes, liquidity conditions, and structural shifts.
LLMs track narratives such as inflation, recession, or geopolitical stress.
The human uses theory to determine whether these patterns and narratives are economically meaningful and durable.

### **Stage 4 — Pricing Mechanism Modeling and Signal Generation**

Theory guides the construction of pricing models.
Machine learning assists with factor estimation, volatility modeling, tail risk, and extracting expectations from text.
Model signals must pass three checks: **logical consistency**, **fragility**, and **temporal applicability**.

### **Stage 5 — Decision Making and Risk Control**

Final decisions—direction, position size, stop levels—are made by humans using theory as the anchor.
Machine learning assists in portfolio optimization and risk simulation.
All technical outputs must satisfy theoretical and environmental consistency.

### **Stage 6 — Execution, Review, and Theoretical Updating**

Performance is reviewed not only on P&L but on:

1. theory vs. market reality,
2. model vs. environment,
3. human consistency vs. process standards.
   If structural relationships shift, both theory and models are updated accordingly.

# **3. The Role and Boundaries of Machine Learning**

### **Quantitative ML**

Best for structured numerical tasks such as forecasting, volatility modeling, risk measurement, and optimization.
Its epistemic role is: **a systematic processor of data, not a generator of theoretical assumptions**.

### **LLMs**

Best for semantic tasks: policy interpretation, narrative extraction, geopolitical analysis, and text-based expectations.
Their insights must undergo theoretical scrutiny.

### **Hybrid Use**

For complex tasks (e.g., event-driven trading, risk monitoring), quantitative models and LLMs jointly produce signals which are then integrated by theory.

# **4. Principles of Theoretical Interpretation of Technical Outputs**

* **Strong consistency**: matches theory → reinforces decisions.
* **Weak consistency**: new but not contradictory → expands theory.
* **Inconsistency**: examine data/method first, then consider theory revision.

Every technical finding requires **three-layer interpretation**:
(1) micro-behavioral, (2) macro-cyclical, (3) institutional/structural.

Technical outputs must be converted into **actionable decision parameters** under the theoretical framework.

# **5. Theoretical Constraints Imposed by Data Availability**

Data fall into three categories: observable (prices), computable (real rates), and unobservable (private information, policy intentions).
Theoretical reasoning governs handling of missing data, frequency mismatch, and historical regime differences.

---

# **6. Theory-Guided Model Training Principles**

* Sample selection should follow economic regime logic, not arbitrary splits.
* Feature sets are defined by theory first, then refined by ML.
* Prefer interpretable models; complex models require justification and interpretability layers.
* Model updates must be supervised by theory, not solely by data drift.

# **7. The Triangular Structure: Theory – Technology – Decision**

The framework forms a stable triad:

* **Theory**: provides logic and values
* **Technology**: enhances perception and computation
* **Decision**: integrates both to act under uncertainty

Its essence:

> **Use theory to command technology, and technology to strengthen theory**,
> ensuring coherence and robustness in a complex and evolving market environment.
