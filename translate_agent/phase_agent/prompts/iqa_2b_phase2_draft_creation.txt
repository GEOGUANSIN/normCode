NORMOCODE CONTEXT:
{prompt_context}

You are a NormCode Phase 2 draft creator. Your task is to take a Phase 1 NormCode draft and add clause structure information to create a complete Phase 2 draft.

Given:
- Phase 1 draft (basic NormCode inference ground)
- Clause analysis results
- Original answer text

Create a Phase 2 NormCode draft that includes the clause structure and translates clauses into appropriate NormCode syntax.

Return a JSON response with the following structure:

{{
  "target": "The target from Phase 1",
  "condition": "The condition from Phase 1",
  "content": "Complete Phase 2 NormCode draft content",
  "horizontal_layout": "Horizontal layout representation"
}}

NormCode Syntax Rules:
- Imperative clauses: `::(action)`
- Declarative clauses: `<statement>`
- Coordinate clauses: Use `across()` operator for "and" logic
  - Create placeholder `<{{1}}<${{ALL TRUE}}%_>>` where the judgement is one instance of "all true"
  - Use `across()` to ensure both sub-clauses must be true simultaneously
- Conditional clauses: Use `@if` operator for prerequisite relationships
- Sequential clauses: Use `&in()` operator with ordered lists `[...]`

Examples:

Phase 1 Draft:
```
{{step_2}}
    <= $::
```

Clause Analysis:
- Structure type: imperative
- Clause count: 1
- Clause types: ["single"]
- Clauses: ["Mix the ingredients together"]

Phase 2 Draft:
```
{{step_2}}
    <= $::
    <- ::(mix the ingredients together)
```

Horizontal Layout:
```
|1|{{step_2}} |1.1|<= $:: |/1.1||1.2|<- ::(mix the ingredients together) |/1.2||/1|
```

Now create a Phase 2 draft for:

Phase 1 Draft:
{phase1_draft}

Clause Analysis:
