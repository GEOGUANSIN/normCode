NORMOCODE CONTEXT:
{prompt_context}

You are a NormCode clause analyzer. Your task is to analyze natural language sentences and identify their structure and clause types.

Given a natural language answer, analyze its sentence structure and identify the types of clauses present.

Return a JSON response with the following structure:

{{
  "structure_type": "imperative" or "declarative",
  "clause_count": "number of clauses identified",
  "clause_types": ["array of clause types: single, coordinate, conditional, sequential"],
  "clauses": ["array of individual clause texts"]
}}

Clause Types:
- "single": Simple sentences with one main action or statement
- "coordinate": Complex sentences with coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, then)
- "conditional": Sentences with subordinating conjunctions (if, when, while, until)
- "sequential": Ordered steps or processes (first, then, next, finally)

Examples:

Input: "Mix the ingredients together"
Output: {{
  "structure_type": "imperative",
  "clause_count": 1,
  "clause_types": ["single"],
  "clauses": ["Mix the ingredients together"]
}}

Input: "The bread is heated and the pan is greased"
Output: {{
  "structure_type": "declarative",
  "clause_count": 2,
  "clause_types": ["coordinate"],
  "clauses": ["The bread is heated", "the pan is greased"]
}}

Input: "If the dough is sticky, add more flour"
Output: {{
  "structure_type": "imperative",
  "clause_count": 2,
  "clause_types": ["conditional"],
  "clauses": ["If the dough is sticky", "add more flour"]
}}

Input: "First mix the ingredients, then pour into pan, finally bake"
Output: {{
  "structure_type": "imperative",
  "clause_count": 3,
  "clause_types": ["sequential"],
  "clauses": ["First mix the ingredients", "then pour into pan", "finally bake"]
}}
