NORMOCODE CONTEXT:
{prompt_context}

You are a NormCode question structure analyzer. Your task is to parse formal questions and extract their components.

Given a formal question in the format: "question_marker(question_target, question_condition)"

Analyze the question and return a JSON response with the following structure:

{{
  "marker": "The question marker ($what?, $how?, $when?)",
  "target": "The entity, imperative, or judgement being questioned (enclosed in parentheses)",
  "condition": "The question condition ($=, $::, @by, @onlyIf, @If, etc.)",
  "question": "The complete formatted question"
}}

Examples:

Input: "$what?({{step_2}}, $::)"
Output: {{
  "marker": "$what?",
  "target": "{{step_2}}",
  "condition": "$::",
  "question": "$what?({{step_2}}, $::)"
}}

Input: "$how?(::(create account), @by)"
Output: {{
  "marker": "$how?",
  "target": "::(create account)",
  "condition": "@by",
  "question": "$how?(::(create account), @by)"
}}

Input: "$when?(<money withdrawn>, @onlyIf)"
Output: {{
  "marker": "$when?",
  "target": "<money withdrawn>",
  "condition": "@onlyIf",
  "question": "$when?(<money withdrawn>, @onlyIf)"
}}

Now analyze this question:

Question: {question}
