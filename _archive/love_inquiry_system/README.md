# Multi-Agent Love Inquiry System

This experiment aims to translate a NormCode decomposition plan (`love_decomposition.md`) into a functioning multi-agent AI system.

## Architecture

- **Orchestrator Agent**: Manages the overall conversational flow based on the plan.
- **Concept Agents**: Specialized agents for each component of "love" (feelings, actions, etc.).
- **Judgement Agent**: Evaluates user input against the plan's conditions.
- **User Interaction Agent**: Handles direct communication with the user.

## Plan

The structured plan, derived from the NormCode, will be stored in the `plan/` directory.
